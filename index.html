          <div>About Me</div>
          <div>
            Currently a student at New Brunswick Community College, I will be
            graduating in 2023. My passion for programming began in the spring
            of 2020 when I taught myself Python in my free time. Wanting to
            pursue my interest in programming, I enrolled at NBCC in the
            Information Technology Programmer-Analyst program. I'm excited to
            apply my knowledge in the IT industry and continue to learn new
            things and improve myself.

          <div>Learning at NBCC</div>
          <div>
            NBCC allowed me to gain experience with programming every day. The
            hands-on experience that NBCC provides with it's teaching let me
            make mistakes, debug, and ultimately understand better what I was
            writing. Learning to write psuedocode, create more efficient code,
            and tracing allowed me to become a better programmer than when I
            entered the program.

            Having completed my undergraduate degree at the Univeristy of
            Manitoba, I have experience with higher mathematics. Having
            completed courses in single variable and multi variable calculus,
            and linear algebra, which is important in the study of machine
            learning and artificial intelligence
